The current FindARide site was created and managed by Sound Transit until 2015 and is now a service of Hopelink. The site was recently redesigned to integrate the new features and updated interface of our sister site, VetsGO.com, and expand our reach to the existing FindARide user base. The two sites share the same features and the same database to provide veterans and other users with the same “one-click” experience. The redesign and ongoing support of the site is made possible by our partnerships with Sound Transit, Washington State Department of Transportation, King County Metro, Aging and Disability Services for Seattle \u0026 King County, and other partners.  \u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eFind a Ride, this website, is a One-Call/One-Click trip planning system. Our trip planner will differ from many trip planning tools in two significant ways: firstly, this system will allow people to request a ride from any service that meets their needs, in one place, without having to call another number or visit another website. Secondly, it will allow users to sort and select options that cater to their unique needs. The system will include information on all partnering transportation services in the region, including specialized transportation programs like shuttles, deviated fixed-route services, and volunteer programs. This level of detail distinguishes Hopelink's Find a Ride trip discovery tool from other common applications. We aim to influence wider-reaching companies to include all specialized services information in their platforms.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003ch2\u003eHopelink Mobility Management\u003c/h2\u003e\r\n\r\n\u003cp\u003eHopelink’s Mobility Management team empowers people to improve their lives by facilitating simplified access to the community. We do this by (1) providing travel education and resources to existing transportation options; (2) supporting the coordination of special needs transportation through cross-sector collaborations; and (3) gathering data and needs assessment to recommend and implement improved services. We work to make it easier for all people to get around King County through innovative and collaborative problem-solving.
